# Walmart Sales Forecasting
Project 2 for PSL (R Edition)


This a schol project version of the Walmart Sales Forecasting kaggle competition, the data has already been cleaned, and the models are tested on 'mymain.R', the approach I took was similar to the winner of the competition where I used an SVD to pre-process the data, then used tslm as my main model.
